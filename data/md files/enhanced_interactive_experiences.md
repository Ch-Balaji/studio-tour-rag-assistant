### Sound Stage Observation
**Location**: Various sound stages (depending on daily production schedule)  
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes per stage  
**Group Size**: 15-40 people per group  
**Age Requirement**: 8+ (must remain quiet)

**The Experience**:

One of the most exciting parts of any studio tour is seeing actual production facilities. While we can't guarantee active filming, visiting a sound stage provides incredible insight into how movies and television shows are made.

**What You'll See**:

**Stage Configuration**:
Depending on the day, you might visit:
- **Active filming** (rare, but possible) - observation from designated area
- **Standing sets between filming** - can go on set, explore
- **Sets under construction** - see carpentry, painting, decorating in progress

**Sound Stage Components Explained**:

**The Space Itself**:
Your guide will point out:
- **Acoustic walls**: Why sound stages are so quiet (demonstrate!)
- **Grid ceiling**: Where lights hang, cables run
  - Look up: see hundreds of rigging points
  - Each point tested regularly for safety
- **Floor**: Perfectly level concrete (why it matters)
- **Doors**: Massive "elephant doors" for moving large sets
  - Red light outside: filming in progress (silent door operation)
  - Green light: stage clear, doors can be opened

**Lighting Systems**:
Extensive lighting demonstration:
- **Practical lights**: Lights that appear in shot (lamps, ceiling fixtures)
- **Production lights**: Illuminate scene
  - Key light: Main illumination
  - Fill light: Softens shadows
  - Back light: Separates subject from background
  - Practical demonstration (if stage available): See how adding/removing lights changes the look

**Types of Lights**:

  - Walls are temporary (can be struck quickly)
  - Wild walls: Walls that can be removed for specific shots
  
- **Ceilings**: Often absent or partial (lights need access)
  - When visible in shot, "ceiling piece" added
  
- **Floors**: Different materials
  - Wood, tile, concrete (whatever character dictates)
  - Often real materials, sometimes painted to look like something else

**Set Dressing**:
The details that make it real:
- **Furniture**: Period-appropriate or style-appropriate
  - May be real antiques or aged reproductions

## TIER 2: PREMIUM EXPERIENCES (Deluxe and VIP Tours)

### Sound Effects Studio Workshop
**Location**: Post-Production Building 15, Foley Stage 3  
**Duration**: 30 minutes (full workshop)  
**Group Size**: 8-12 people per session  
**Age Requirement**: 10+ (requires following detailed instructions)  
**Availability**: Deluxe and VIP tours, scheduled sessions

**The Experience**:

Step into the world of Foley artistry and sound design! This hands-on workshop teaches you how everyday objects create the sounds you hear in movies. You'll create sound effects for an actual movie clip, learning techniques used by professional sound designers.

**What is Foley?**

Named after Jack Foley, a Hollywood sound pioneer, Foley is the art of creating everyday sound effects to enhance films:
- Footsteps
- Clothing rustling
- Doors opening/closing
- Objects being handled
- Environmental sounds

**Why not just record these sounds during filming?**
- Set noise interferes (crew, equipment)
- Dialogue microphones don't capture environment well
- Need flexibility to adjust in post-production
- Sound must be "larger than life" for cinematic impact

**The Workshop Structure**:

**Part 1: Introduction and Demonstration** (5 minutes)

Your Foley artist instructor (yes, a real professional!) welcomes you to the Foley stage.

**The Foley Stage**:
What you're standing in:
- Sound-isolated room (extremely quiet)
- Multiple surface types:
  - Wood floor section
  - Tile section
  - Gravel pit
  - Grass mat
  - Marble section
  - Metal grate
  - Carpet section
- Walls lined with acoustic treatment
- Recording equipment at the ready

**Instructor demonstrates**:
Creates sound effects live while you watch:
- Walks across gravel (crunch crunch)
- Opens creaky door (actually a rusty hinge on a board)
- Punches happen (cabbage impact sounds like face punch!)
- Horse hooves (coconut shells on hard surface)
- Fire crackling (cellophane crinkled slowly)

**Mind = Blown**: What looks like one thing, sounds like something completely different!

**Part 2: The "Foley Pit"** - Props and Materials (5 minutes)

Explore the Foley pit: hundreds of objects used to create sounds:

**Footwear Collection**:
- 50+ pairs of shoes (men's, women's, boots, heels, sneakers)
- Why so many? Different characters need different sounds
- Weight and stride affect sound
- Material of shoe matters (leather vs. rubber)

**Surface Materials**:
- Gravel (different sizes)
- Leaves (different types, dry vs. wet)
- Sand
- Snow substitute (corn starch on leather)
- Mud substitute (combination of materials)

**Clothing and Fabrics**:
- Leather jacket (creaking)
- Silk scarf (swooshing)
- Denim (rustling)
- Nylon windbreaker (swishing)
- Chain mail (metal links)

**Impact Objects**:
- Vegetables (cabbages, celery, watermelon for body impacts)
- Phone books (useful for many impacts)
- Leather gloves (for handling sounds)

**Special Effect Items**:
- Coconut shells (horse hooves)
- Corn starch box (walking in snow)
- Leather wallet (wing flaps of birds)
- Latex gloves filled with water (squishy sounds)
- Bubble wrap (multiple uses)

**Mechanical Objects**:
- Door hinges (squeaks)
- Locks and latches
- Chains
- Metal poles and sheets (sci-fi sounds)
- Springs

**Part 3: The Movie Clip** (2 minutes)

Instructor shows the clip you'll work on:

**The Scene**: 
A 2-minute action sequence from "City Chase" (fictional short film created specifically for this workshop):
- Character runs down alley
- Climbs chain-link fence
- Drops to other side
- Runs through puddle
- Opens metal door
- Enters building
- Quick fight sequence (3 punches, throw against wall)
- Exit through window (glass breaking)

**Watch It Three Ways**:
1. **Complete with sound**: The finished version (how it should sound)
2. **Without Foley**: Only dialogue and music (notice how empty it feels!)
3. **With visual reference markers**: Numbers count down to each sound needed

**How many individual sounds needed?**
Count with us: 47 separate sound effects in 2 minutes!

**Part 4: Hands-On Creation** (15 minutes)

Now you're the Foley artists!

**Group Division**:
Divided into three teams:
- **Team Footsteps**: All walking, running, landing sounds
- **Team Props**: Doors, fences, objects
- **Team Impacts**: Fight sounds, body impacts

**Recording Process**:
Professional equipment:
- Each team at a microphone station
- Wear headphones (hear the clip, hear yourselves)

  - Instructor guides: "More aggressive! Shake harder!"
  
- Opening metal door
  - Use actual door on hinges
  - Hinges creak (perfect!)
  - Latch clicking
  - Door handle turning

  - Timing must be perfect
  
- Body throw against wall
  - Use padded mat
  - Instructor might demonstrate (safely!)
  - Create "whump" sound

  - Arm movements creating swooshes

**Multiple Takes**:
Like real production:
- First take: Learning, timing off
- Second take: Better, but could improve
